# GhostFilter - Sensitive URL Filter Tool

**GhostFilter** is a lightweight, powerful tool designed to help security professionals and bug hunters filter sensitive URLs from large datasets.

GhostFilter helps identify potential security vulnerabilities related to sensitive paths, API endpoints, configuration files, and more.

## Features
